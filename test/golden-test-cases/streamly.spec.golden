%description
Streamly is a monad transformer unifying non-determinism
(<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/list-t
list-t>/<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/logict logict>), concurrency
(<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/async async>), streaming
(<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit
conduit>/<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes pipes>), and FRP
(<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Yampa
Yampa>/<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reflex reflex>) functionality in a
concise and intuitive API. High level concurrency makes concurrent applications
almost indistinguishable from non-concurrent ones. By changing a single
combinator you can control whether the code runs serially or concurrently.
It naturally integrates concurrency with streaming rather than adding it as an
afterthought. Moreover, it interworks with the popular streaming libraries.

See the README for an overview and the haddock documentation for full
reference. It is recommended to read the comprehensive tutorial module
"Streamly.Tutorial" first. Also see "Streamly.Examples" for some working
examples.
