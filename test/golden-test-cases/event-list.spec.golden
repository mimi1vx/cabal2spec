%description
These lists manage events that are associated with times. Times may be given as
difference between successive events or as absolute time values.
Pauses before the first and after the last event are supported. The underlying
data structures are lists of elements of alternating types, that is
[b,a,b,...,a,b] or [a,b,a,...,a,b]. The data structures can be used to
represent MIDI files, OpenSoundControl message streams, music performances etc.
