%description
It turns out that this combinator

> f ~'~ g = (f .) . (. g)

is a powerful thing. It was abstracted from following (commonly used) pattern
'f . h . g' where 'f' and 'g' are fixed.

This library not only defines '~@~' combinator, but also some derived
combinators that can help us easily define a lot of things including lenses.
See <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens package> for detais on what
lenses are.

Function 'Data.Function.on' can be implemented using '~@~' as:

> on :: (b -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> a -> c > on f g = (id ~'~ g ~'~ g) f

If function 'on3' existed in /base/ then it could be defined as:

> on3 :: (b -> b -> b -> d) -> (a -> b) -> a -> a -> a -> d > on3 f g = (id ~'~
g ~'~ g ~'~ g) f

Other usage examples and documentation can be found in "Data.Function.Between"
module.
