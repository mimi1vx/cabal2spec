%description
The 'base' library exposes the 'hGetEcho' and 'hSetEcho' functions for querying
and setting echo status, but unfortunately, neither function works with MinTTY
consoles on Windows. This is a serious issue, since 'hGetEcho' and 'hSetEcho'
are often used to disable input echoing when a program prompts for a password,
so many programs will reveal your password as you type it on MinTTY!

This library provides an alternative interface which works with both MinTTY and
other consoles. An example is included which demonstrates how one might prompt
for a password using this library. To build it, make sure to configure with the
'-fexample' flag.
