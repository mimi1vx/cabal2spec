%description
Allows tests such as QuickCheck properties and HUnit test cases to be assembled
into test groups, run in parallel (but reported in deterministic order, to aid
diff interpretation) and filtered and controlled by command line options.
All of this comes with colored test output, progress reporting and test
statistics output.
