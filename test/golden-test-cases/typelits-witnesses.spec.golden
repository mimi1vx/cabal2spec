%description
Provides witnesses for 'KnownNat' and 'KnownSymbol' instances for various
operations on GHC TypeLits - in particular, the arithmetic operations defined
in "GHC.TypeLits", and also for type-level lists of 'KnownNat' and
'KnownSymbol' instances.

This is useful for situations where you have ''KnownNat' n', and you want to
prove to GHC ''KnownNat' (n + 3)', or ''KnownNat' (2*n + 4)', or when
constraints on the lower or upper limits of 'n' are needed.

It's also useful for when you want to work with type level lists of 'KnownNat'
or 'KnownSymbol' instances and singletons for traversing them, and be able to
apply analogies of 'natVal' and 'symbolVal' to lists with analogies for
'SomeNat' and 'SomeSymbol'.

Note that most of the functionality in this library can be reproduced in a more
generic way using the great <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons
singletons> library. The versions here are provided as a "plumbing included"
alternative that makes some commonly found design patterns involving GHC's
TypeLits functionality a little smoother, especially when working with external
libraries or GHC TypeLit's Nat comparison API.

See README for more information.
