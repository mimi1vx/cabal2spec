%description
Type-enforced sorted lists and related functions.

These are useful for:

* Constraining the argument of a function to be a sorted list by stating in
your type that the input list is a sorted list.

* Avoiding sorting a list twice.

* Creating a list that is sorted from the moment of its construction, so it
doesn't have to be sorted later.

* Performing list operations keeping the input list sorted.

* Improving those list operations that can be benefited from the ordering of
its elements.

* Creating infinite lists that are sorted!

* And more!

If you are missing a feature, do not hesitate to ask by opening an issue at the
bug-tracker.
