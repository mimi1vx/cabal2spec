%description
Random number generation based on entropy sources able to produce a small but
well-defined set of primitive variates. Also includes facilities for
"completing" partial implementations, making it easy to define new entropy
sources in a way that is naturally forward-compatible.

Changes in 0.3.0.6: Fixed overzealous fix in 0.3.0.5. The people responsible
for sacking the people who have been sacked, etc., have been sacked.

Changes in 0.3.0.5: Renamed some internal modules and accidentally some
external ones too. Whoops. Please don't use this version, it will only end in
tears.

Changes in 0.3.0.4: Fixed a typo that broke building with MTL-1

Changes in 0.3.0.3: Fixes for GHC's deprecation of Foreign.unsafePerformIO

Changes in 0.3.0.2: Fixes for GHC 7.2.*'s crazy Template Haskell changes.
