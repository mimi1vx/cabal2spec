%description
Haskell Image Processing (HIP) Library provides an easy to use interface with a
whole variaty of image manipulation capabilities.

Processing can be done sequentially as well as in parallel, with an inherited
fusion capabily, all through <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa repa>
and <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector vector> packages. It is highly
extendable, with an ability to add various color spaces or provide
implementations for underlying array like custom data structures.

It is capable of reading and writing a number of popular image formats by using
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/JuicyPixels JuciyPixels> and
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/netpbm netpbm> packages. Being a pure
Haskell library it does not require any external programs, although it can
display images using a program of your choice.
