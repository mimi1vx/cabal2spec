%description
This package provides combinators for sequencing IO actions onto a thread pool.
The thread pool is guaranteed to contain no more unblocked threads than a
user-specified upper limit, thus minimizing contention.

Furthermore, the parallel combinators can be used reentrantly - your parallel
actions can spawn more parallel actions - without violating this property of
the thread pool.

The package is inspired by the thread
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/56499/focus=56521>.
Thanks to Neil Mitchell and Bulat Ziganshin for some of the code this package
is based on.
