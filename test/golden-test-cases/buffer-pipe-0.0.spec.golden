%description
Read from stdin and write to stdout in large blocks. This can be inserted in a
chain of piping commands. E.g. if inserted after 'tar c' or before 'tar x' you
can reduce jumping forth and back on the hard disk.

You may also try the 'buffer' command from the Debian package of the same name.
