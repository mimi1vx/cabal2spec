%description
Read, Show and Binary instances do not check for internal data references to
the same address. As a result, the data is duplicated when serialized.
This is a waste of space in the filesystem and also a waste of serialization
time. but the worst consequence is that, when the serialized data is read, it
allocates multiple copies for the same object when referenced multiple times.
Because multiple referenced data is very typical in a pure language such is
Haskell, this means that the resulting data loose the beatiful economy of space
and processing time that referential transparency permits.

In this release:

Compatibility with older versions of bytestring that have no 'toStrict' call

deserialization is much, much faster by using the stringsearch package

See "Data.RefSerialize" for details.
