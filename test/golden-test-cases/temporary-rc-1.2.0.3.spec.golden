%description
The functions for creating temporary files and directories in the base library
are quite limited. The unixutils package contains some good ones, but they
aren't portable to Windows. This library just repackages the Cabal
implementations of its own temporary file and folder functions so that you can
use them without linking against Cabal or depending on it being installed.
This is a better maintained fork of the "temporary" package.
