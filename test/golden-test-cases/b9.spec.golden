%description
Build virtual machine images for vm-deployments; resize, un-partition, create
from scratch or convert disk image files in a variety of formats; assemble and
generate all associated files from templates and regular files. VM images can
further be modifed through scripts, which are executed in LXC containers into
which the vm-images as well as arbitrary directories from the host are mounted.
All assembled files can also be accessed by vm build scripts through a special
directory mounted in the build container, and/or can be written to directories,
ISO- or VFAT-images. The ISO/VFAT images that B9 creates are compatible to
'cloud-init's 'NoCloud' data source; B9 is also very well suited for compiling
in a containerized environment. For these applications, the images can be
marked as 'Transient' to indicate no further interest in the VM-image itself,
and B9 will discard them after the build. B9 will never over-write source
files, not even large vm-image files - there is no intended way to modify a
source vm-image file 'in-place'. B9 operates in random build directories, which
are discarded when the build exists.
