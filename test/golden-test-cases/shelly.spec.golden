%description
Shelly provides convenient systems programming in Haskell, similar in spirit to
POSIX shells. Shelly:

* is aimed at convenience and getting things done rather than being a
demonstration of elegance.

* has detailed and useful error messages

* maintains its own environment, making it thread-safe.

* is modern, using Text and system-filepath/system-fileio

Shelly is originally forked from the Shellish package.

See the shelly-extra package for additional functionality.

An overview is available in the README:
<https://github.com/yesodweb/Shelly.hs/blob/master/README.md>.
