/Overview/

The io-streams library contains simple and easy-to-use primitives for I/O using
streams. Most users will want to import the top-level convenience module
"System.IO.Streams", which re-exports most of the library:

' import System.IO.Streams (InputStream, OutputStream) import qualified
System.IO.Streams as Streams '

For first-time users, 'io-streams' comes with an included tutorial, which can
be found in the "System.IO.Streams.Tutorial" module.

/Features/

The 'io-streams' user API has two basic types: 'InputStream a' and
'OutputStream a', and three fundamental I/O primitives:

' -- read an item from an input stream Streams.read :: InputStream a -> IO
(Maybe a)

-- push an item back to an input stream Streams.unRead :: a -> InputStream a ->
IO ()

-- write to an output stream Streams.write :: Maybe a -> OutputStream a -> IO
() '

Streams can be transformed by composition and hooked together with provided
combinators:

' ghci> Streams.fromList [1,2,3::Int] >>= Streams.map (*10) >>= Streams.toList
[10,20,30] '

Stream composition leaves the original stream accessible:

' ghci> input <- Streams.fromByteString "long string" ghci> wrapped <-
Streams.takeBytes 4 input ghci> Streams.read wrapped Just "long" ghci>
Streams.read wrapped Nothing ghci> Streams.read input Just " string" '

Simple types and operations in the IO monad mean straightforward and simple
exception handling and resource cleanup using Haskell standard library
facilities like 'Control.Exception.bracket'.

'io-streams' comes with:

* functions to use files, handles, concurrent channels, sockets, lists,
vectors, and more as streams.

* a variety of combinators for wrapping and transforming streams, including
compression and decompression using zlib, controlling precisely how many bytes
are read from or written to a stream, buffering output using bytestring
builders, folds, maps, filters, zips, etc.

* support for parsing from streams using 'attoparsec'.

* support for spawning processes and communicating with them using streams.
