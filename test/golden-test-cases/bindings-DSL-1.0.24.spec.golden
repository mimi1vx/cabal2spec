%description
This is a set of macros to be used when writing Haskell FFI. They were designed
to be able to fully describe C interfaces, so that hsc2hs can extract from them
all Haskell code needed to mimic such interfaces. All Haskell names used are
automatically derived from C names, structures are mapped to Haskell instances
of Storable, and there are also macros you can use with C code to help write
bindings to inline functions or macro functions. Documentation is available at
package homepage:

<https://github.com/jwiegley/bindings-dsl/wiki>

The extra module Bindings.Utilities will contain tools that may be convenient
when working with FFI.
