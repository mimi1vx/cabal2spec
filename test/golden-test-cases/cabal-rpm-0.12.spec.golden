%description
This package provides a RPM packaging tool for Haskell Cabal-based packages.

cblrpm has commands to generate a RPM spec file and srpm for a package.
It can rpmbuild packages, yum/dnf install their dependencies, prep packages,
and install them. There are commands to list package dependencies and missing
dependencies. The diff command compares the current spec file with a freshly
generated one, the update command updates the spec file to latest version from
Stackage or Hackage, and the refresh command updates the spec file to the
current cabal-rpm packaging.
