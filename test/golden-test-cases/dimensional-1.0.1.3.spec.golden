%description
Dimensional is a library providing data types for performing arithmetic with
physical quantities and units. Information about the physical dimensions of the
quantities and units is embedded in their types and the validity of operations
is verified by the type checker at compile time. The boxing and unboxing of
numerical values as quantities is done by multiplication and division with
units. The library is designed to, as far as is practical, enforce/encourage
best practices of unit usage. Version 1 of the dimensional package differs from
earlier version in that the dimension tracking is implemented using Closed Type
Families and Data Kinds rather than functional dependencies. This enables a
number of features, including improved support for unit names and quantities
with statically-unknown dimensions. Requires GHC 7.8 or later.
