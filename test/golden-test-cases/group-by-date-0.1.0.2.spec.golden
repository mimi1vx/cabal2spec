%description
This program is intended for grouping photography images by date into a
hierarchy of date related folders.

If you have a folder of photographies, say 'photos', you may run

> group-by-date -r photos

The program will emit a Bash script like this one:

> mkdir -p 2017/2017-06/2017-06-28 && mv photos/0001.jpeg
2017/2017-06/2017-06-28 > mkdir -p 2017/2017-06/2017-06-28 && mv
photos/0002.jpeg 2017/2017-06/2017-06-28 > mkdir -p 2017/2017-06/2017-06-28 &&
mv photos/0003.jpeg 2017/2017-06/2017-06-28

You can inspect the script and if you like it, you can run it:

> group-by-date -r photos | bash

If you want a different command, say copying with preservation of modification
time, you can call

> group-by-date --command='cp -p' -r photos

Alternatively, you can run the actions immediately, that is, without a Bash
script:

> group-by-date --mode=move -r photos > group-by-date --mode=copy -r photos

You can also change the target directory structure using the '--format' option.
You can list all options and default values using '--help'.

Attention: Media for photographies is often formatted with FAT. This may yield
trouble with respect to timezones.
