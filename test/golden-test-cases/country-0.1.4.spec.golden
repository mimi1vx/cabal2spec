%description
The `country` library provides a data type for dealing with the set of
countries as defined by ISO 3166. The representation is compact and is
well-suited to use with vectors and primitive arrays. Additionally, this
library exports functions that provide the following encodings and decodings:

* ISO Alpha-2 (two-letter country code)

* ISO Alpha-3 (three-letter country code)

* ISO Numeric (three-digit country code)

Please open up an issue on github if there is anything you would like to see
added.
