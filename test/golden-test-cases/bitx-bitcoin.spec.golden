%description
Haskell bindings to the BitX REST API, as described here:
<https://bitx.co/api>.

Note that since this library interfaces directly with a financial API, great
care must be taken in its use. In particular, the author cannot be held
accountable for any financial losses as a result of programming error, whether
that error is in your code, the code of the author of this library, or BitX's
code. This is just common sense.

If you need to make sure that nothing funny happens in the code, apart from
reading the source yourself, you should also perform a few test transactions
with very small denominations, as I will strive to do every time before
releasing a new version.

For a very small usage example, see "Network.Bitcoin.BitX.Public".
