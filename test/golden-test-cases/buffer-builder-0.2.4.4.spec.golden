%description
"Data.BufferBuilder" is an efficient library for incrementally building up
'ByteString's, one chunk at a time. Early benchmarks show it is over twice as
fast as ByteString Builder, primarily because 'BufferBuilder' is built upon an
ST-style restricted monad and mutable state instead of ByteString Builder's
monoidal AST.

Internally, BufferBuilder is backed by a few C functions. Examination of GHC's
output shows nearly optimal code generation with no intermediate thunks -- and
thus, continuation passing and its associated indirect jumps and stack traffic
only occur when BufferBuilder is asked to append a non-strict ByteString.

I benchmarked four approaches with a URL encoding benchmark:

* State monad, concatenating ByteStrings: 6.98 us

* State monad, ByteString Builder: 2.48 us

* Crazy explicit RealWorld baton passing with unboxed state: 28.94 us (GHC
generated really awful code for this, but see the revision history for the
technique)

* C + FFI + ReaderT: 1.11 us

Using BufferBuilder is very simple:

> import qualified Data.BufferBuilder as BB > > let byteString =
BB.runBufferBuilder $ do > BB.appendBS "http" > BB.appendChar8 '/' >
BB.appendBS "//"

This package also provides "Data.BufferBuilder.Utf8" for generating UTF-8
buffers and "Data.BufferBuilder.Json" for encoding data structures into JSON.
