%description
A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to the
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5 MD5 hash algorithm> (including
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC HMAC> support) with performance close to
the fastest implementations available in other languages.

The implementation is made in C with a haskell FFI wrapper that hides the C
implementation.

NOTE: This package has been forked off 'cryptohash-0.11.7' because the
'cryptohash' package has been deprecated and so this package continues to
satisfy the need for a lightweight package providing the MD5 hash algorithm
without any dependencies on packages other than 'base' and 'bytestring'.

Consequently, this package can be used as a drop-in replacement for
'cryptohash''s "Crypto.Hash.MD5" module, though with a clearly smaller
footprint.
