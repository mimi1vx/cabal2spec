%description
Efficient and easy-to-use bindings to (slightly modified) libpqtypes, lipq
extension that adds support for binary transport format and composite types.

Since modified libpqtypes is used, its source code is bundled along with the
bindings. The differences between verbatim libpqtypes and the one used by this
package:

* per-thread global error structures were replaced by explicit passing of these
structures around so that there is no need to use bound threads.

* handlers that take values to be put into the database were modified to always
expect pointers to objects, as opposed to previous situation where primitives
were being taken by value (which was convenient if the library was used
directly from C, but created inconsistency problems while trying to define
bindings in a sensible way).

Examples can be found in the
<https://github.com/scrive/hpqtypes/tree/master/examples examples> directory.
