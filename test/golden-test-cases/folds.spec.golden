%description
This package is a playground full of comonadic folds.

This style of fold is documented in
<https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/edwardk/cellular-automata/part-2 "Cellular
Automata, Part II: PNGs and Moore">

This package can be seen as what happens if you chase Max Rabkin's
<http://squing.blogspot.com/2008/11/beautiful-folding.html "Beautiful Folding">
to its logical conclusion.

More information on this approach can be found in the
<http://conal.net/blog/posts/another-lovely-example-of-type-class-morphisms
"Another lovely example of type class morphisms"> and
<http://conal.net/blog/posts/more-beautiful-fold-zipping "More beautiful fold
zipping"> posts by Conal Elliott, as well as in Gabriel Gonzales'
