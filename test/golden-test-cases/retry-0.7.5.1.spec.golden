%description
This package exposes combinators that can wrap arbitrary monadic actions.
They run the action and potentially retry running it with some configurable
delay for a configurable number of times. The purpose is to make it easier to
work with IO and especially network IO actions that often experience temporary
failure and warrant retrying of the original action. For example, a database
query may time out for a while, in which case we should hang back for a bit and
retry the query instead of simply raising an exception.
