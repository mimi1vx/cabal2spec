%description
This package is not very different from the other SQLite3 bindings out there,
but it fixes a few deficiencies I was finding. As compared to bindings-sqlite3,
it is slightly higher-level, in that it supports marshalling of data values to
and from the database. In particular, it supports strings encoded as UTF8, and
BLOBs represented as ByteStrings.
