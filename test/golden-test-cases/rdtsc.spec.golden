%description
This module provides the function 'rdtsc' for accessing the 'rdtsc' machine
register on modern IA-32 processors. This is a 64-bit counter which counts the
number of processor cycles since the machine has been powered up.
Using this instruction, you can make very precise time measurements which are
independent of the actual CPU frequency. But note that you can get strange
results sometimes on a superscalar processor.

Also note that the Haskell foreign function interface imposes some additional
overheads. On my machine, it takes about 950 cycles to call this function twice
and to compute the difference, whereas in C the overhead is only about 88
cycles.
