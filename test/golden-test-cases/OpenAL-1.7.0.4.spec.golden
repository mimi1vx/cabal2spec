%description
A Haskell binding for the OpenAL cross-platform 3D audio API, appropriate for
use with gaming applications and many other types of audio applications.

On Windows, this package works well with the "OpenAL Soft" binary distribution
from <http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html>. Type 'cabal install
--extra-lib-dirs=<DIR>' where <DIR> is the directory where libOpenAL32.dll.a is
located (must be an absolute path). Then rename soft_oal.dll to OpenAL32.dll
and put it somewhere in the PATH. I found that c:\Windows\ worked.

This package has also been tested on GNU/Linux and iOS.
