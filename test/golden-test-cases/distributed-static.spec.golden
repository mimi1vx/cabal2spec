%description
/Towards Haskell in the Cloud/ (Epstein et al, Haskell Symposium 2011)
introduces the concept of /static/ values: values that are known at compile
time. In a distributed setting where all nodes are running the same executable,
static values can be serialized simply by transmitting a code pointer to the
value. This however requires special compiler support, which is not yet
available in ghc. We can mimick the behaviour by keeping an explicit mapping
('RemoteTable') from labels to values (and making sure that all distributed
nodes are using the same 'RemoteTable'). In this module we implement this
mimickry and various extensions: type safety (including for polymorphic static
values) and compositionality.
