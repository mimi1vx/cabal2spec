%description
CSV files are the de-facto standard in many situations involving data transfer,
particularly when dealing with enterprise application or disparate database
systems.

While there are a number of CSV libraries in Haskell, at the time of this
project's start in 2010, there wasn't one that provided all of the following:

* Full flexibility in quote characters, separators, input/output

* Constant space operation

* Robust parsing, correctness and error resiliency

* Convenient interface that supports a variety of use cases

* Fast operation

This library is an attempt to close these gaps. Please note that this library
started its life based on the enumerator package and has recently been ported
to work with conduits instead. In the process, it has been greatly simplified
thanks to the modular nature of the conduits library.

Following the port to conduits, the library has also gained the ability to
parameterize on the stream type and work both with ByteString and Text.
