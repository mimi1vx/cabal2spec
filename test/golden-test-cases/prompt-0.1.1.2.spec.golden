%description
Monad (and transformer) for delayed-effect "pure" prompt-and-response queries.

Allows you to specify programs that might query a database, talk to stdio,
etc., without ever involving IO or opening the door to arbitrary IO.
Write a potentially pure computation describing prompting interactions, etc.,
without having your type actually do any IO or involve itself with IO or any
effectful context.

Useful as a source of "things from IO", without ever actually involving IO or
arbitrary IO itself; only executing a specific subset of IO (or State, etc.)
that you yourself, the caller, specifies explicitly. Safer and more meaningful
type.

For more information and instructions on usage with examples, see
<https://github.com/mstksg/prompt the README>.

Not quite related to the /MonadPrompt/ library.
