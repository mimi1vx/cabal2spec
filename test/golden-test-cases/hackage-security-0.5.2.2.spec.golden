%description
The hackage security library provides both server and client utilities for
securing the Hackage package server (<http://hackage.haskell.org/>).
It is based on The Update Framework (<http://theupdateframework.com/>), a set
of recommendations developed by security researchers at various universities in
the US as well as developers on the Tor project
(<https://www.torproject.org/>).

The current implementation supports only index signing, thereby enabling
untrusted mirrors. It does not yet provide facilities for author package
signing.

The library has two main entry points: "Hackage.Security.Client" is the main
entry point for clients (the typical example being 'cabal'), and
"Hackage.Security.Server" is the main entry point for servers (the typical
example being 'hackage-server').
