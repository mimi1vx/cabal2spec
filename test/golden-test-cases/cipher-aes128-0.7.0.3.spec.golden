%description
Cipher-aes128 is an implementation of AES and common modes of operation.
It borrows Hanquez's C AES code (see 'cipher-aes') but is unique due to
including compile-time detection of NI compiler support, a slightly more
functional interface for GCM operations, exposure of 'Ptr' based operations via
the .Internal module, and build-in crypto-api support. Cipher-aes128 was
originally developed as "'cipher-aes' plus trampolines", which has since been
adopted into cipher-aes.
