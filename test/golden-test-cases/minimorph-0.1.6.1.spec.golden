%description
A set of simplistic functions capturing the more regular parts of English
spelling (for generation, not parsing). You will need to complement this with
some account for irregular nouns/verbs. This package is not meant to provide
anything resembling a full account of English morphology (something like
Functional Morphology or sequor could be better suited). The main goal is to
provide something cheap and cheerful with no learning curve, that you can use
until your application calls for more robustness. See
<https://github.com/Mikolaj/miniutter> for a simple use case.
