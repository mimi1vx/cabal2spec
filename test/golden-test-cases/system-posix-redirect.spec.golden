%description
Due to the design of POSIX, it is possible to temporarily overload the file
descriptors corresponding to stdout and stderr to point to an arbitrary pipe.
It is, however, tricky to get right. This module gets it right, as far as such
a terrible hack can be made right. It can be used to make misbehaving
third-party C libraries stop spewing to standard output. Warning: the module
author has concluded that due to lack of portability, this module should not be
used in any serious sytem. But, for those who like living dangerously...
