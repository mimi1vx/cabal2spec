%description
This library provides machinery for types to specify how they can be serialized
and deserialized into/from Thrift payloads. It makes no assumptions on how
these payloads are sent or received and performs no code generation.
Types may specify how to be serialized and deserialized by defining instances
of the 'Pinchable' typeclass by hand, or with automatically derived instances
by using generics. Check the documentation in the "Pinch" module for more
information.

/What is Thrift?/ Apache Thrift provides an interface description language, a
set of communication protocols, and a code generator and libraries for various
programming languages to interact with the generated code. Pinch aims to
provide an alternative implementation of Thrift for Haskell.
