%description
Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a
data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and
sorted sets. This library is a Haskell client for the Redis datastore.
Compared to other Haskell client libraries it has some advantages:

[Compatibility with Latest Stable Redis:] Hedis is intended to be used with the
latest stable version of Redis (currently 3.2). Most redis commands
(<http://redis.io/commands>) are available as haskell functions, although
MONITOR and SYNC are intentionally omitted. Additionally, a low-level API is
exposed that makes it easy for the library user to implement further commands,
such as new commands from an experimental Redis version.

[Automatic Optimal Pipelining:] Commands are pipelined
(<http://redis.io/topics/pipelining>) as much as possible without any work by
the user. See <http://informatikr.com/2012/redis-pipelining.html> for a
technical explanation of automatic optimal pipelining.

[Enforced Pub/Sub semantics:] When subscribed to the Redis Pub/Sub server
(<http://redis.io/topics/pubsub>), clients are not allowed to issue commands
other than subscribing to or unsubscribing from channels. This library uses the
type system to enforce the correct behavior.

[Connect via TCP or Unix Domain Socket:] TCP sockets are the default way to
connect to a Redis server. For connections to a server on the same machine,
Unix domain sockets offer higher performance than the standard TCP connection.

For detailed documentation, see the "Database.Redis" module. .
