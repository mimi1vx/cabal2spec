%description
Run IO actions lazily while respecting their order. Running a value of the
LazyIO monad in the IO monad is like starting a thread which is however driven
by its output. That is, the LazyIO action is only executed as far as necessary
in order to provide the required data.

The package may help you to avoid stack overflows in 'mapM'. Say you have

> mapM f xs

where 'xs' is a long list. When run, you may encounter a stack overflow.
To prevent it, write instead:

> import qualified System.IO.Lazy as LazyIO > > LazyIO.run $ mapM
(LazyIO.interleave . f) xs

The stack overflow is gone.
