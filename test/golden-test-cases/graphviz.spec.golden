%description
This library provides bindings for the Dot language used by the Graphviz
(<http://graphviz.org/>) suite of programs for visualising graphs, as well as
functions to call those programs.

Main features of the graphviz library include:

* Almost complete coverage of all Graphviz attributes and syntax.

* Support for specifying clusters.

* The ability to use a custom node type.

* Functions for running a Graphviz layout tool with all specified output types.

* The ability to not only generate but also parse Dot code with two options:
strict and liberal (in terms of ordering of statements).

* Functions to convert FGL graphs and other graph-like data structures to Dot
code - including support to group them into clusters - with a high degree of
customisation by specifying which attributes to use and limited support for the
inverse operation.

* Round-trip support for passing an FGL graph through Graphviz to augment node
and edge labels with positional information, etc.
