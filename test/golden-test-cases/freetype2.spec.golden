What is FreeType 2?

FreeType 2 is a software font engine that is designed to be small, efficient,
highly customizable, and portable while capable of producing high-quality
output (glyph images). It can be used in graphics libraries, display servers,
font conversion tools, text image generation tools, and many other products as
well.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of features provided by FreeType 2.

* FreeType 2 provides a simple and easy-to-use API to access font content in a
uniform way, independently of the file format. Additionally, some
format-specific APIs can be used to access special data in the font file.

* Unlike most comparable libraries, FreeType 2 supports scalable font formats
like TrueType or Type 1 natively and can return the outline data (and control
instructions/hints) to client applications.

By default, FreeType 2 supports the following font formats.

* TrueType fonts (and collections)

* Type 1 fonts

* CID-keyed Type 1 fonts

* CFF fonts

* OpenType fonts (both TrueType and CFF variants)

* SFNT-based bitmap fonts

* X11 PCF fonts

* Windows FNT fonts

* BDF fonts (including anti-aliased ones)

* PFR fonts

* Type 42 fonts (limited support)

From a given glyph outline, FreeType 2 is capable of producing a high-quality
monochrome bitmap, or anti-aliased pixmap, using 256 levels of 'gray'.
This is much better than the 5 levels used by Windows 9x/98/NT/2000 or FreeType
1.

FreeType 2 supports all the character mappings defined by the TrueType and
OpenType specification. It is also capable of automatically synthetizing a
Unicode charmap from Type 1 fonts, which puts an end to the painful 'encoding
translation' headache common with this format (of course, original encodings
are also available in the case where you need them).

The FreeType 2 core API provides simple functions to access advanced
information like glyph names or kerning data.

FreeType 2 provides information that is often not available from other similar
font engines, like kerning distances, glyph names, vertical metrics, etc.

FreeType 2 provides its own caching subsystem since release 2.0.1. It can be
used to cache either face instances or glyph images efficiently.
