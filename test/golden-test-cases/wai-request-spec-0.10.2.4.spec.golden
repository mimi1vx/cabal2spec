%description
WAI Request Spec is a declarative validation layer for HTTP requests.
It aims to make error-handling for malformed requests as easy as taking the
happy path.

A brief summary of the core features:

* Can specify headers and query params as input sources

* Support for parsing ints, floats, text, bytes (with encodings), and bools

* A parser combinator interface for chaining together request requirements

* Support for Alternatives

* Support for optional parameters

* Convenient and informative default error messages that let service consumers
know what went wrong

It is built on WAI, so it is compatible with several Haskell web frameworks.
All you need is the ability to access the Request object, and WAI Request Spec
takes care of the rest!.
