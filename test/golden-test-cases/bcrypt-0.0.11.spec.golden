%description
Haskell bindings to the bcrypt password hash.

Unlike other bindings already in existence, this package is designed to allow
users to work directly with password hash strings that include information
about the hashing algorithm, strength, and salt. This approach allows hashed
passwords to be stored in a single field that can also be used by non-Haskell
applications, and makes it easy to implement a policy of updating passwords
hashed to an old policy next time the plaintext password is available.

Version 1.1.3 of the OpenWall C source for bcrypt is included in this package
(<http://www.openwall.com/crypt/>). The only modification is that the flag
which enables the use of assembler has been disabled. Announcements about
hs-bcrypt (including security announcements) will be sent to
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hs-bcrypt-announce/join - if you use
this library please consider subscribing. This mailing list is moderated and is
expected to have a very low volume of mail traffic.
