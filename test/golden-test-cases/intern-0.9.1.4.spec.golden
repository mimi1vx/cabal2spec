%description
Changes from 0.8 to 0.9

* Removed 'identity' from the Interned class, to support applications where the
identity is obtained by other means (e.g. a unique Ptr value)

Changes from 0.7 to 0.8

* Disabled cache removal as it was causing problems on large data sets.
There is no good way to ensure that both references remain alive long enough to
finish comparisons. * Switched to IORef from MVar

Changes from 0.6 to 0.7

* Fixed problem where comparisons could happen between data structures while
one was still a thunk, leading to equal structures comparing as inequal in
limited circumstances, by appropriately using strictness annotations.

Efficient hash-consing for arbitrary data types

Changes from 0.5.2 to 0.6

* Widened the caches so they don't go through a single MVar per type.
This has made a dramatic impact on performance. However, this broke the
previous invariant that newer entries always had higher Ids than older entries.

Changes from 0.5.1 to 0.5.2

* Added Data.Interned.IntSet.
