%description
Provides Template Haskell functions that mimic deriving extensions that were
introduced or modified in recent versions of GHC. Currently, the following
typeclasses/extensions are covered:

* Deriving 'Bounded'

* Deriving 'Enum'

* Deriving 'Ix'

* Deriving 'Eq', 'Eq1', and 'Eq2'

* Deriving 'Ord', 'Ord1', and 'Ord2'

* Deriving 'Read', 'Read1', and 'Read2'

* Deriving 'Show', 'Show1', and 'Show2'

* 'DeriveFoldable'

* 'DeriveFunctor'

* 'DeriveTraversable'

See the "Data.Deriving" module for a full list of backported changes.

Note that some recent GHC typeclasses/extensions are not covered by this
package:

* 'DeriveDataTypeable'

* 'DeriveGeneric', which was introducted in GHC 7.2 for deriving 'Generic'
instances, and modified in GHC 7.6 to allow derivation of 'Generic1' instances.
Use 'Generics.Deriving.TH' from
'<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-deriving generic-deriving>' to
derive 'Generic(1)' using Template Haskell.

* 'DeriveLift', which was introduced in GHC 8.0 for deriving 'Lift' instances.
Use 'Language.Haskell.TH.Lift' from
'<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-lift th-lift>' to derive 'Lift' using
Template Haskell.

* The 'Bifunctor' typeclass, which was introduced in GHC 7.10, as well as the
'Bifoldable' and 'Bitraversable' typeclasses, which were introduced in GHC 8.2.
Use 'Data.Bifunctor.TH' from '<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bifunctors
bifunctors>' to derive these typeclasses using Template Haskell.
