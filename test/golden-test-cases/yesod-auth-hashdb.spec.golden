%description
This package is the Yesod.Auth.HashDB plugin, originally included as part of
yesod-auth, but now modified to be more secure and placed in a separate
package.

It provides authentication using hashed passwords stored in a database, and
works best in situations where an administrator is involved in setting up a
user with an initial password.

The complete login process, including a default form, is implemented by this
plugin, but the application developer must design the interfaces for setting up
users and allowing them to change their own passwords, since only the low-level
password-setting functions are provided by this package. (Note that other
authentication plugins may be more appropriate if you wish to use email
verification to set up accounts).
