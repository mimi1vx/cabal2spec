%description
This library is for working with "'.tar'" archive files. It can read and write
a range of common variations of archive format including V7, POSIX USTAR and
GNU formats.

It provides support for packing and unpacking portable archives. This makes it
suitable for distribution but not backup because details like file ownership
and exact permissions are not preserved.

It also provides features for random access to archive content using an index.
