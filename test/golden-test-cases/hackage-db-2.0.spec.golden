%description
This is an early and mostly undocumented release of the 2.x version of
hackage-db that's intended mostly for experimenting with and testing of the new
API. Porting code from 1.x to 2.x is pretty simple, but if you do that at this
point, please expect minor details of this API to change in forthcoming
releases. For production code, you are probably better off with the 1.x release
for now.

Check out https://github.com/peti/hackage-db/tree/master/example/ for a
collection of simple example programs that demonstrate how to use this code.
