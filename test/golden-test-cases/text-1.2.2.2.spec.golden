%description
An efficient packed, immutable Unicode text type (both strict and lazy), with a
powerful loop fusion optimization framework.

The 'Text' type represents Unicode character strings, in a time and
space-efficient manner. This package provides text processing capabilities that
are optimized for performance critical use, both in terms of large data
quantities and high speed.

The 'Text' type provides character-encoding, type-safe case conversion via
whole-string case conversion functions. It also provides a range of functions
for converting 'Text' values to and from 'ByteStrings', using several standard
encodings.

Efficient locale-sensitive support for text IO is also supported.

These modules are intended to be imported qualified, to avoid name clashes with
Prelude functions, e.g.

> import qualified Data.Text as T

To use an extended and very rich family of functions for working with Unicode
text (including normalization, regular expressions, non-standard encodings,
text breaking, and locales), see the 'text-icu' package:
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-icu>.
