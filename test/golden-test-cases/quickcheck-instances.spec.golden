%description
QuickCheck instances.

The goal is to supply QuickCheck instances for types provided by the Haskell
Platform.

Since all of these instances are provided as orphans, I recommend that you do
not use this library within another library module, so that you don't impose
these instances on down-stream consumers of your code.

For information on writing a test-suite with Cabal see
<https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#test-suites>.
