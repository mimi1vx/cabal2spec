%description
Convertible provides a typeclass with a single function that is designed to
help convert between different types: numeric values, dates and times, and the
like. The conversions perform bounds checking and return a pure Either value.
This means that you need not remember which specific function performs the
conversion you desire.

Also included in the package are optional instances that provide conversion for
various numeric and time types, as well as utilities for writing your own
instances.

Finally, there is a function that will raise an exception on bounds-checking
violation, or return a bare value otherwise, implemented in terms of the safer
function described above.

Convertible is also used by HDBC 2.0 for handling marshalling of data to and
from databases.

Convertible is backed by an extensive test suite and passes tests on GHC and
Hugs.
