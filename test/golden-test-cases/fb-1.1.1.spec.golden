%description
This package exports bindings to Facebook's APIs (see
<http://developers.facebook.com/>). Does not have any external dependencies and
tries to use as little resources (such as memory, sockets and CPU) as possible
by using packages such as 'aeson', 'attoparsec', 'bytestring', 'conduit',
'http-conduit', 'text' and others.

While we would like to have a complete binding to Facebook's API, this package
is being developed on demand. If you need something that has not been
implemented yet, please send a pull request or file an issue on GitHub
(<https://github.com/psibi/fb/issues>).
