%description
Bake is a continuous integration server, designed for large, productive,
semi-trusted teams.

* /Large teams/ where there are at least several contributors working full-time
on a single code base.

* /Productive teams/ which are regularly pushing code, many times a day.

* /Semi-trusted teams/ where code does not go through manual code review, but
code does need to pass a test suite and perhaps some static analysis.
People are assumed not to be malicious, but are fallible.
