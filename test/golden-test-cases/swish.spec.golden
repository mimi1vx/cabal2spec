%description
Swish is a framework, written in the purely functional programming language
Haskell, for performing deductions in RDF data using a variety of techniques.
Swish is conceived as a toolkit for experimenting with RDF inference, and for
implementing stand-alone RDF file processors (usable in similar style to CWM,
but with a view to being extensible in declarative style through added Haskell
function and data value declarations). It explores Haskell as "a scripting
language for the Semantic Web".

Swish is a work-in-progress, and currently incorporates:

* Turtle, Notation3 and NTriples input and output. The N3 support is incomplete
(no handling of '@forAll').

* RDF graph isomorphism testing and merging.

* Display of differences between RDF graphs.

* Inference operations in forward chaining, backward chaining and
proof-checking modes.

* Simple Horn-style rule implementations, extendable through variable binding
modifiers and filters.

* Class restriction rule implementation, primarily for datatype inferences.

* RDF formal semantics entailment rule implementation.

* Complete, ready-to-run, command-line and script-driven programs.
