%description
Split a big audio file into pieces at positions of silence. You can use this to
split a recording of multiple songs into single songs.

> $ split-record recording.wav "part%03d.wav"

You can also calculate split positions only. They are computed lazily.
They can be loaded into Audacity for further fine tuning and to perform the
actual split. For generating only labels, run:

> $ split-record recording.wav > labels.txt.
