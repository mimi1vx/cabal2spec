%description
Implementation of lists whose number of elements is a power of two.
Binary lists have this property by definition, so it is impossible to build a
value with other kind of length. The implementation take advantage of this
property to get additional performance.

Some algorithms are designed to work only when the input list has length a
power of two. Use binary lists to ensure this property in the input.
In addition, this library exports some useful functions for this kind of
algorithms. An example implementing the Fast Fourier Transform is provided in
the "Data.BinaryList" module.

The package contains an additional module with utilities for the
(de)serialization of binary lists.
