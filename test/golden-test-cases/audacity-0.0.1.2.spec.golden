%description
This package provides functions for interchange with the Audacity sound signal
editor. Currently we support import and export of label tracks, export of
Audacity projects and limited import of tracks from Audacity projects.

We provide some examples that are useful on its own:

* 'sox-concat': Concatenate a sequence of sound files with matching sampling
rates and numbers of channels using SoX and generate an Audacity label track
file that shows the origins of the parts.

* 'audacity-concat': Create an Audacity project file containing a virtual
concatenation of the input sound files and a label track showing the origins of
the sound files.

* 'audacity-combine': Put several audio and label files into tracks of a new
Audacity project. Opening one or even multiple such projects is much easier
than loading individual tracks into Audacity.
