%description
This empty package does not provide any modules; its sole purpose is to provide
the 'network-uri' Cabal flag logic below so you don't have to include that
boilerplate in your '.cabal' file.

> flag network-uri > description: Get Network.URI from the network-uri package
> default: True > > library > if flag(network-uri) > build-depends: network-uri
>= 2.6, network >= 2.6 > else > build-depends: network-uri < 2.6, network < 2.6

This avoids combining 'network-uri >= 2.6' with 'network < 2.6' which both
export a name-clashing 'Network.URI' module, because in network-2.6 the
'Network.URI' module was split off from the network package into
network-uri-2.6.

In other words, the logic above makes sure that the 'Network.URI' module is
provided by either 'network-uri' or by 'network' (in the
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or XOR> sense).

In order to benefit from this module, simply include it in your 'build-depends'
declaration alongside 'network' and 'network-uri'.

> build-depends: > network >= 2.5 && < 2.7, > network-uri >= 2.7 && < 2.8, >
network-uri-flag == 0.1.*

/NOTE: It's almost always an error to list this package if network and
network-uri aren't both listed as well!/.
