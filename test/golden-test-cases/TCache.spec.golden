%description
TCache is a transactional cache with configurable persitence. It allows
conventional STM transactions for objects that syncronize with their
user-defined storages. State in memory and into permanent storage is
transactionally coherent.

It has interface defined for Amazon WS and Yesod Persistent backends defined in
tcache-<backend> packages. Persistent is a multi-backend interface for SQL and
non SQL databases such in Mongo-db

The package implements serializable STM references, access by key and by record
field value, triggers, full text and field indexation, default serialization
and a query language based on record fields

Since the STM references can be included in data structures and serialized,
this is right for graph databases and other NoSQL databases.

0.12.0 space in index data in indexQuery.hs and IndexText.hs triggered errors
in the AWS backend. The space has been changed by '-'. So rename the "index *"
files in the TCache folder in order to be recognized.

0.11.0.0 added setIndexParsist to define persistence for indexes by type.
started the addition of readDBRefs, readResources and so on for simultaneous
read, writes and deletes of objects of the same type.

0.10.2.0 Added setDefaultPersist and modified the signature of setPersist in
Data.TCache.DefaultPersistence. Fixed issues with ghc 7.6.3

0.10 version add memoization and a persistent and transactional
collection/queue.

0.10.0.8 subversion add cachedByKeySTM

0.10.0.9 fixed an error in clearSyncChacheProc and SynWrite Asyncronous that
checked the cache continuously

See "Data.TCache" for details

In this release:

Dropped Data.Hashtable (deprecated). Now it uses the package hashtables.
