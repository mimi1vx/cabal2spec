%description
This library can be used to generate random sequences of anything with a
behaviour that is adapted to some training data. Input a marketing text or a
speech and recompose it to another arbitrary text of this sort. Input a
dictionary of person names and create new names. Input a sequence of notes and
get out a new melody. Input a set of Haskell modules and generate ...
nice idea but the result will certainly have neither correct syntax nor types.
I think, it's a good thing about Haskell, that you cannot fool it so easily.
The idea is very simple: The algorithm analyses your input/training data with
respect to how likely an 'a' or 'e' follows the letters 'r' and 'e'.
Then on recomposition it chooses subsequent letters randomly according to the
frequencies found in the training data. This library is well suited for
/bull-shit generators/.
