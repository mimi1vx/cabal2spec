%description
This Haskell package provides a data structure of sets that are indexed by
potentially multiple indices.

Sets can be created, modified, and queried in various ways.

The package is a variant of the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ixset
ixset> package. The ixset package makes use of run-time type information to
find a suitable index on a query, resulting in possible run-time errors when no
suitable index exists. In ixset-typed, the types of all indices available or
tracked in the type system. Thus, ixset-typed should be safer to use than
ixset, but in turn requires more GHC extensions.

At the moment, the two packages are relatively compatible. As a consequence of
the more precise types, a few manual tweaks are necessary when switching from
one to the other, but the interface is mostly the same.
