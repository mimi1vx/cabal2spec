%description
A /priority search queue/ efficiently supports the opperations of both a search
tree and a priority queue. A 'Binding' is a product of a key and a priority.
Bindings can be inserted, deleted, modified and queried in logarithmic time,
and the binding with the least priority can be retrieved in constant time.
A queue can be built from a list of bindings, sorted by keys, in linear time.
