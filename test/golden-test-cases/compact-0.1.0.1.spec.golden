%description
This package provides user-facing APIs for working with "compact regions",
which hold a fully evaluated Haskell object graph. These regions maintain the
invariant that no pointers live inside the struct that point outside it, which
ensures efficient garbage collection without ever reading the structure
contents (effectively, it works as a manually managed "oldest generation" which
is never freed until the whole is released). This package is currently highly
experimental, but we hope it may be useful to some people. It is GHC 8.2 only.
The bare-bones library that ships with GHC is ghc-compact.
