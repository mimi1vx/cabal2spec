%description
Contains renderers and parsers for both XML and HTML 5 document fragments,
which share data structures so that it's easy to work with both.
Document fragments are bits of documents, which are not constrained by some of
the high-level structure rules (in particular, they may contain more than one
root element).

Note that this is not a compliant HTML 5 parser. Rather, it is a parser for
HTML 5 compliant documents. It does not implement the HTML 5 parsing algorithm,
and should generally be expected to perform correctly only on documents that
you trust to conform to HTML 5. This is not a suitable library for implementing
web crawlers or other software that will be exposed to documents from outside
sources. The result is also not the HTML 5 node structure, but rather something
closer to the physical structure. For example, omitted start tags are not
inserted (and so, their corresponding end tags must also be omitted).
