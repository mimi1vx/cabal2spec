%description
An IRC client library built atop
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/irc-conduit irc-conduit>. Why another IRC
client library, you cry? I didn't really find one that did what I wanted
(specifically, handle connecting to servers and calling event handlers,
possibly with TLS), but which didn't implement almost a full IRC bot for you.
That takes out all the fun!

<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/irc-conduit irc-conduit> and
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/irc-ctcp irc-ctcp> are my solution to the
first part of that, this is my solution to the latter. It's a simple IRC client
library that does the basics for you, but isn't an all-singing, all-dancing,
fully-featured IRC /application/. It is a merely a simple library.
