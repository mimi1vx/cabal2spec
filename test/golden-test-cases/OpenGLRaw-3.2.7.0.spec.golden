%description
OpenGLRaw is a raw Haskell binding for the OpenGL 4.5 graphics system and lots
of OpenGL extensions. It is basically a 1:1 mapping of OpenGL's C API, intended
as a basis for a nicer interface. OpenGLRaw offers access to all necessary
functions, tokens and types plus a general facility for loading extension
entries. The module hierarchy closely mirrors the naming structure of the
OpenGL extensions, making it easy to find the right module to import.
All API entries are loaded dynamically, so no special C header files are needed
for building this package. If an API entry is not found at runtime, a userError
is thrown.

OpenGL is the industry's most widely used and supported 2D and 3D graphics
application programming interface (API), incorporating a broad set of
rendering, texture mapping, special effects, and other powerful visualization
functions. For more information about OpenGL and its various extensions, please
see <http://www.opengl.org/> and <http://www.opengl.org/registry/>.
