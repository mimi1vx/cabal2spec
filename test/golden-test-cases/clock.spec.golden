%description
A package for convenient access to high-resolution clock and timer functions of
different operating systems via a unified API.

POSIX code and surface API was developed by Cetin Sert in 2009.

Windows code was contributed by Eugene Kirpichov in 2010.

FreeBSD code was contributed by Finn Espen Gundersen on 2013-10-14.

OS X code was contributed by Gerolf Seitz on 2013-10-15.

Derived 'Generic', 'Typeable' and other instances for 'Clock' and 'TimeSpec'
was contributed by Mathieu Boespflug on 2014-09-17.

Corrected dependency listing for 'GHC < 7.6' was contributed by Brian McKenna
on 2014-09-30.

Windows code corrected by Dimitri Sabadie on 2015-02-09.
