%description
Protein Data Bank file format is a most popular format for holding biological
macromolecular data.

This is a very fast sequential parser:

* below 7s for the largest entry in PDB - 1HTQ which is over 70MB - as compared
with

* 11s of RASMOL 2.7.5,

* or 2m15s of BioPython with Python 2.6 interpreter.

In its parallel incarnation it is most probably the fastest parser for PDB
format.

It is aimed to not only deliver event-based interface, but also a high-level
data structure for manipulating data in spirit of BioPython's PDB parser.
