%description
This is hledger's curses-style interface. It is simpler and more convenient for
browsing data than the command-line interface, but lighter and faster than
hledger-web.

hledger is a cross-platform program for tracking money, time, or any other
commodity, using double-entry accounting and a simple, editable file format.
It is inspired by and largely compatible with ledger(1). hledger provides
command-line, curses and web interfaces, and aims to be a reliable, practical
tool for daily use.
