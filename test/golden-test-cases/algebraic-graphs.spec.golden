%description
<https://github.com/snowleopard/alga Alga> is a library for algebraic
construction and manipulation of graphs in Haskell. See
<https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper this paper> for the motivation
behind the library, the underlying theory and implementation details.

The top-level module
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph.html
Algebra.Graph> defines the core data type
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph.html#t:Graph
Graph>, which is a deep embedding of four graph construction primitives
/empty/, /vertex/, /overlay/ and /connect/. More conventional graph
representations can be found in
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-AdjacencyMap.html
Algebra.Graph.AdjacencyMap> and
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-Relation.html
Algebra.Graph.Relation>.

The type classes defined in
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-Class.html
Algebra.Graph.Class> and
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-HigherKinded-Class.html
Algebra.Graph.HigherKinded.Class> can be used for polymorphic graph
construction and manipulation. Also see
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-Fold.html
Algebra.Graph.Fold> that defines the Boehm-Berarducci encoding of algebraic
graphs and provides additional flexibility for polymorphic graph manipulation.

This is an experimental library and the API will be unstable until version
1.0.0. Please consider contributing to the on-going
<https://github.com/snowleopard/alga/issues discussions on the library API>.
