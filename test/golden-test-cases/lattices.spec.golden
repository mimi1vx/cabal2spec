%description
In mathematics, a lattice is a partially ordered set in which every two
elements 'x' and 'y' have a unique supremum (also called a least upper bound,
join, or 'x /\ y') and a unique infimum (also called a greatest lower bound,
meet, or 'x \/ y').

This package provide type-classes for different lattice types, as well as a
class for the partial order.
